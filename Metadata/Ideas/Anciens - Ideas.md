### The Fall of the Ancients

The Ancients likely fell when they attempted to record the Anomaly in their Chronicles. In trying to document that which negates existence, they fractured their connection to the Facets. Their scattered knowledge explains why fragments appear in places like the Abysse de la Solitude. This event may have accelerated the progression toward the End of Times.
